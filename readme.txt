"Square Stacker" - Inspiration for this game came from the game "Scoops" where you try to stack ice cream as high as you can

About the Game/How to play:
- The goal of the game is to catch/stack as many falling squares as you can
- Squares fall randomly 1 at a time and you are allowed to catch/avoid how many you want as long as you catch them enough to stack and they do not collide with your stack
- If you press BUTTON_A while you have a stack during the game, the game will stop, and then you will get points for how many squares you stacked (10 points per square)
- The points will be calcualated after you stop the game
- After collecting your points, press BUTTON_START to start a new round of catching squares to add points to your current score
- If a square collides with your stack and it is not caught then the game is over and your score is set back to 0
- Try to get as many points as possible and challenge yourself by stacking the squares high!
- IMPORTANT: Squares must be caught accurately on top of one another to be caught or else you might lose so be careful! If you canâ€™t get to a square in time just let it fall
- The game can be paused by pressing BUTTON_START
- Continue means continue the game and continue to collect points and add to your score
- Restart means set your score back to zero and play again

How to run:
